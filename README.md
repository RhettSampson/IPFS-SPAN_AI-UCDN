# IPFS-SPAN_AI-UCDN
A proposal and discussion forum to develop and integrate the IPFS protcol stack from Protocol Labs with the SPAN-AI protocol stack from GT Systems to create a Universal Content Distribution Network (UCDN) which could potentially form the foundation of the next gneration of the Internet.

This repo is for open dissussion of the pros and cons of doing that and how best to do it. It is open to anyone, but especially intended for the IPFS, Filecoin, SPAN-AI and general Internet communities. 

Please raise new major discussion themes as issues and add discussion on themes as comments on the issues.

Remember to please:
-be civil
-on topic
-and as concise as possible

It will hopefully form the basis of an initial project action plan and issues register.
